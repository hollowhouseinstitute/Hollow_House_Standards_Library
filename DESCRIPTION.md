Hollow House Standards Library — Core reference suite for data, documentation, and ethical-AI standards across the Hollow House Institute ecosystem.

This library defines how all Hollow House repositories handle **relational-psychology data, AI–human interaction logs, nervous-system research, and co-regulation frameworks**. It provides a single source of truth for how datasets are structured, documented, licensed, and evaluated before they are shared with researchers, data brokers, or product teams.

The Standards Library includes:

- **Data & Metadata Standards**  
  Schemas, field definitions, timestamp conventions, anonymization rules, and data dictionaries for relational-AI, nervous-system, and family/attachment datasets.

- **Documentation & Process Standards**  
  Templates for READMEs, dataset cards, model cards, changelogs, contribution guidelines, and audit logs so every repo in the ecosystem is consistent and easy to understand.

- **Ethical & Safety Standards**  
  Principles and criteria for handling trauma-adjacent material, AI–human co-regulation data, and sensitive psychological content, aligned with the Hollow House Flame License and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

- **Certification Criteria & Checklists**  
  Benchmarks for evaluating whether an AI system, dataset, or framework qualifies for Hollow House certification in areas like safety, documentation quality, relational intelligence, and governance.

This repository is intended for **researchers, AI developers, data stewards, and ethics leads** who want to understand how Hollow House Institute designs, governs, and certifies high-quality relational datasets and AI systems. By centralizing standards here, we support **reproducible research, ethical reuse, and trustworthy AI-human relation modeling** across the entire Hollow House Institute ecosystem.
