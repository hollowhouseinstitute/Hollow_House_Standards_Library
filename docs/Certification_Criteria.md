# Certification Criteria
Outline of criteria and benchmarks used by the Hollow House Institute for certifying AI systems, relational datasets, and cognitive frameworks.
# Certification Criteria

The **Hollow House Institute Certification Criteria** establishes clear benchmarks for evaluating the integrity, structure, and ethical quality of:
- AI systems and relational agents  
- Dataset and codex repositories  
- Cognitive or emotional frameworks designed for human–AI co-regulation  

---

## Core Evaluation Pillars

1. **Ethical Alignment**  
   - Adherence to Flame License and CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.  
   - Explicit boundaries for data privacy, authorship, and non-commercial use.

2. **Data Integrity**  
   - Proper anonymization and metadata traceability.  
   - Consistent schema, timestamp, and attribution standards.

3. **Relational Quality**  
   - Evidence of co-regulation, attunement, and non-exploitative modeling in AI training data.  
   - Balanced tone and emotional-safety markers in dialogue sets.

4. **Documentation and Transparency**  
   - Complete README, LICENSE, and dataset dictionary.  
   - Version history and change logs maintained in the repo root.

5. **Impact and Reproducibility**  
   - Datasets or frameworks must be testable, citeable, and replicable.  
   - Ethical audit pathway clearly defined.
