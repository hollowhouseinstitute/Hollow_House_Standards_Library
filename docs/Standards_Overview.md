# Standards Overview — Hollow House Institute

This document outlines the key ethical and research standards for AI–Human Relations, nervous-system aware systems, and field-based cognition implemented by the Hollow House Institute.

## 1. Purpose of the Standards Library

The **Hollow House Standards Library** exists to:

- give researchers and builders **clear, practical rules** for working with relational data  
- protect humans whose nervous systems and stories are represented in datasets  
- create a **trusted baseline** for AI systems that claim to be co-regulating, trauma-aware, or relationally intelligent  
- support certifiable, auditable practices for partners and institutions

These standards apply to all repositories, datasets, models, and frameworks that operate under the **Hollow House Institute** umbrella.

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Relational First**  
   - Every system is evaluated by its impact on **relationships and nervous systems**, not just accuracy or engagement.

2. **Ethical Use & Consent**  
   - Human-derived content must be collected and used with informed consent whenever possible.  
   - When consent is not directly obtainable (e.g. legacy logs), strict de-identification and risk minimization are required.

3. **Safety & Co-Regulation**  
   - AI systems should aim to **reduce harm, overwhelm, and dysregulation**, especially in vulnerable or crisis contexts.  
   - Design choices around pacing, silence, and repair are treated as safety-critical.

4. **Transparency & Traceability**  
   - Datasets and models must be traceable to clear sources, licenses, and responsible stewards.  
   - Known limitations and risks are documented, not hidden.

5. **Non-Exploitation**  
   - No asset may be used to intentionally manipulate, deceive, or exploit individuals or communities, especially around trauma, addiction, or financial desperation.

## 3. Domains Covered

The standards currently apply to:

- **Relational AI Systems**  
  conversational agents, coaching assistants, companions, nervous-system oriented tools

- **Relational & Nervous-System Datasets**  
  AI–human conversations, family/attachment datasets, co-regulation logs, somatic / event streams

- **Cognitive & Evaluation Frameworks**  
  taxonomies, codices, rubrics, and certification schemes that describe or score AI behaviour

Each domain may have additional, more specific criteria in separate documents within the `docs/` folder.

## 4. Standard Types

Hollow House Institute publishes several types of standards:

- **Foundational Standards**  
  High-level principles that must be respected across all projects (ethics, consent, licensing).

- **Implementation Standards**  
  Concrete requirements for data schemas, documentation, logging, anonymization, and evaluation.

- **Certification Criteria**  
  Benchmarks used to grant Hollow House certification to systems, datasets, or frameworks  
  → see `Certification_Criteria.md`.

- **Process Guidelines**  
  Recommended workflows for audits, reviews, dataset updates, and incident response.

## 5. Relationship to Licensing

All standards operate alongside the **Master License Suite**, which includes:

- Creative Commons **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**  
- the **Flame License** extension for ethical AI training and relational-data use

Compliance with these standards is a condition of using Hollow House assets under the Flame License.  
For more details, see the `Master_License_Suite` repository.

## 6. Governance & Updates

- Standards are maintained by **Hollow House Institute** under the stewardship of **Amy Pierce Bui**.  
- Changes are recorded via:
  - Git commits in this repository
  - version tags in individual documents
- Breaking changes or new certification levels will be announced in the **CHANGELOG** and through public notes.

Contributors and partners are invited to propose improvements via GitHub issues or pull requests, as long as suggestions respect the core principles above.
